I'm a computer science PhD who likes tinkering with machine learning, algorithms, games, and computer graphics.

Formerly at the <a href="https://www.helsinki.fi/en/researchgroups/constraint-reasoning-and-optimization">Constraint Reasoning and Optimization</a> group at University of Helsinki.

This site is a collection of my personal projects and other work.
